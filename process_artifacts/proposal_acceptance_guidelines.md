# OVAL Language Proposal Acceptance Criteria

_A work in progress, this document will provide the specific and general acceptance critera used by Area Supervisors to determine the disposition of a given proposal. Area Supervisors are responsible for judging the disposition of the consensus process (from time to time, the Board may be required to assist). Ideally, each area would either reference a general set of acceptance guidelines or they would have specific acceptance guidelines to help such judgement be more transparent._
