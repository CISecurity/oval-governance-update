# Using Issues 

Creating an Issue is the first step in modifying the OVAL language. The Issue should clearly describe a defect in OVAL or an opportunity to enhance OVAL so the community can have a productive conversation about the Issue before commencing work on a Proposal to resolve it.

# Creating an Issue

Anyone may create an Issue! When creating an Issue, please follow these guidelines:

- **Issue Title**: summarize the issue concisely (try for 8 words or less!)
- **Issue Type**: mark the issue as a Defect, Enhancement or Other:

  - **Defects** are Issues that describe something broken in OVAL. Defects are typically a deviation between an OVAL schema and its documentation or another violation of the OVAL Design Principles.
  - **Enhancements** are Issues that describe an opportunity to improve OVAL (other than by fixing a Defect!). Enhancements are typically adding an attribute, test or schema that results in additional capabilities. Deprecating or removing elements would also be an Enhancement.
  - **Other**: anything else!
  
- **Issue Priority**: mark the Issue as High, Normal or Low priority:

  - **High Priority**: Issues that have a frequent and significant impact on OVAL users
  - **Normal Priority**: Issues that have frequent or significant impact on OVAL users or have a demonstrable negative impact on OVAL adoption
  - **Low Priority**: All other Issues
  
- **Issue Priority Explanation**: explain your Priority selection.
- **Issue Subject**: list any OVAL schema(s) that would need to be revised or created in order to resolve the Issue. If the Issue affects process documentation, scripts, etc. please list them here.
- **Issue Author**: please introduce yourself and describe how you are affected by the Issue. E.g. are you a tool vendor trying to complete an implementation, an end-user unable to complete an accurate scan, a content author unable to write a complete definition, or? This helps the community discuss the Issue with you.
- **Issue Description**: describe the Issue in detail. If the Issue is a Defect, this should include steps necessary to reproduce the Defect. If the Issue is an Enhancement, this should include examples of how the enhancement might be used and how it fits into the OVAL use cases.
- **Implementation Considerations (optional)**: if you are aware of any particular challenges, subtleties or other factors that should be considered when implementing a resolution to the Issue, please include them here.
- **Implementation Ideas (optional)**: if you have specific ideas for implementing a resolution to the Issue, please include them here.
- **Proposal Intentions**: please indicate whether or not you intend to submit a Proposal to address this Issue.

# Responding to an Issue

- **Clarifications Questions**: if you don't understand the Issue, please ask questions!
