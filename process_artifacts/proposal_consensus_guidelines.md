# OVAL Language Consensus Guidelines

_A work in progress, this document provides guidelines concerning building consensus around one or more language proposals. The Consensus Process is open to all community members - supervisors, leadership, sponsor, developers, consumers, producers - and intended to be lightweight, and to encourage collaboration on a single proposal vice many competing proposals._

### Rough Consensus
The intent behind consensus here is the notion of what is known as [rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus). This does not require all participants to agree, and it's not a voting mechanism. The gist of it is that no serious, unaddressed objections exist. As mentioned in the previously described characteristics, it will be up to the Area Supervisors to judge rough consensus. Then, if there is an objection to a proposal, and that objection has been sufficiently addressed, then we can move forward. Conversely, if there is an objection that has not been sufficiently addressed, we know the process cannot move forward. This notion has worked well in other venues, and we believe it will serve us well here also.

### Consensus Calls
Our process has embedded explicit consensus mechanisms at appropriate points. In particular, new proposals and updates to design principles both require consensus calls. The point is that we can add a consensus call mechanism wherever we feel it may be appropriate - we need not relegate consensus calls only to language updates, but can use it for process updates, documentation updates, and the like.

### Handling Proposals with Minimal Interest
Because our process is open to the possibility of accepting proposals that may not enjoy wide interest, it may end up being the case that a proposal "gets through" consensus, even though only two or three parties support it (everyone else may be completely indifferent). In this situation, there are *no objections* to the proposal, but there's also not necessarily a critical mass of support. In this case, there is no harm in such a minimally supported proposal "making it through" - there are, after all, no objections to the proposal, and we must assume that those interested in that particular area are paying attention enough to otherwise object.
