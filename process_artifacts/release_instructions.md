# OVAL Language Release Instructions

_A work in progress, this document will provide the explicit guidance Area Supervisors will use when releasing language files under their purview._

# OVAL Language Release Streams
There are four distinct release streams used to balance varying stakeholder needs for langauge stability and agility. These streams are envisioned as being implemented as git branches:

* **Extensions:** Proposals that are not accepted, but that the Proposal author or supervisor wants to make available as an unofficial extension
* **Development:** accepted Proposals that haven’t been released
* **Release:** all accepted Proposals released every 6 months
* **Official:** a Release that the Board decides is “official” each year
