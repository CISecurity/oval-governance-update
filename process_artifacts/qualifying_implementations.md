# Qualifying Implementations

This document defines the requirements for Qualifying Implmentations that are required by the [OVAL Release Instructions](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/blob/master/process_artifacts/release_instructions.md).

### Each Qualifying Implementation MUST be Independent

The developers, the OVAL engine and the organization of each Qualifying Implmentation MUST be completely distinct from those on all other Qualifying Implementations for the Proposal. 

If multiple implementations have overlapping developers, OVAL engine(s) and/or organization(s), only the implementation with the the highest point score (see below) will be considered a Qualifying Implmentation.

### 15 Points Required

In order to be considered Stable, a proposal MUST have at least 15 points of Qualifying Implementations, assigned as follows:

- 5 points will be granted for each Qualifying Implmentation submitted by an organization that is a member of the OVAL Adoption Program as a Definition Evaluator
- 10 points will be granted for each Qualifying Implememntation submitted by an organization that has successfully completed a recognized 3rd-party OVAL testing program (see list below) so long as the Qualifying Implementation uses the same implmentation that was tested
- 10 points will be granted for each Qualifying Implememntation accompanied by documentation of comprehensive UNIT test coverage (as determined by the Area Supervisor)

When a Qualifying Implementation qualifies for multiple scores, only the highest single score will be counted.

### Recognized 3rd-party OVAL testing Programs

The following programs are currently recognized by this community:

- The NIST SCAP Validation program

This list may be amended at the discretion of the OVAL Board.
