# OVAL Design Principles

Requirements language in this document are defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). Design principles are categorized as generally applicable or applicable to the versions as indicated. An update mechanism is built into the language development process to account for the fact that new design principles may be desired in the future.


# General OVAL Design Princples
## High-Level

- Capabilities SHOULD NOT require changes to scanned systems in order to implement (e.g. be read-only)
- Changes SHOULD NOT impose security issues
- Changes SHOULD NOT result in inconsistency
- Changes SHOULD NOT require obsoleted technologies or methodologies
- Changes SHOULD NOT require the use of undocumented APIs
- Changes SHOULD NOT duplicate existing capabilities unless there is a compelling reason to do so (e.g. major simplification), in which case they should be designed to allow for the deprecation and ultimate replacement of the constructs that are duplicated
- OVAL capabilities should fit into the OVAL use cases
- Capabilities SHOULD NOT dictate implementation, but should document at least one practical implementation method

## Construct-Specific

- An OVAL Item MUST model the posture attribute data being collected off an endpoint
- An OVAL Item MUST NOT combine multiple system-level structures
- OVAL Items SHOULD only include the OVAL Entities that the community requires
- An OVAL Object SHOULD include the minimum set of OVAL Entities needed to uniquely identify an OVAL Item collected from an endpoint

## Mechanics (naming, versioning, etc.)

- Changes SHOULD NOT break backwards compatibility within their major version (i.e. 5.x, 6.x, etc.)
- OVAL constructs MUST conform to naming conventions (http://ovalproject.github.io/getting-started/best-practices/#4-naming-conventions)
- OVAL constructs MUST follow the versioning policy
