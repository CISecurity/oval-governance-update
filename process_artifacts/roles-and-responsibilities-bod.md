# OVAL Leadership Board Roles and Responsibilities
This document characterizes the roles and responsibilities of the OVAL Leadership Board (the "Board" or "Leadership Board"). The Leadership Board is an instrumental body of willing and qualified organizations who are expected to help steer the overarching direction of the OVAL Language.

Requirements language in this document are defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

# General Responsibilities
In general, members of the Leadership Board will be:

* Responsible for steering the OVAL Mission, Use Cases and providing guidance to other key strategic artifacts including the OVAL Design Principles
* Expected to monitor project activities and weigh in on issues facing the Community, especially in areas in which they have special expertise
* Expected to offer guidance to the Community when called on by the Supervisors and/or Community Members, as outlined by the language development process (see "Language Governance Responsibilities" below)
* Expected to engage in online and in-person events subject to their availability
* Expected to advocate on behalf of the project to the general public when appropriate
* Expected to participate in quarterly calls

# Language Governance Responsibilities
The Leadership Board plays a role in various aspects of the overall language development process.

## Language Development
In overall language development, the Leadership Board has an important, direct function in providing guiding support to a consensus call, when needed.

* Consensus Call Support: Exact details, TBD.


### Update Design Principles
As proposals to the language are received in the language development process, we may find a need to update the OVAL Design Principles. A specific subprocess has been defined to handle this case, where the Leadership Board plays an important role.

* Review Proposed Update: All parties review the proposed update to the design principles
* Suggest Change: All parties are able to suggest changes to the proposed update
* Create Consensus Call: The leadership board MUST formally call for consensus on the design principle update proposal
* Address Issue: When issues are raised during a formal consensus call, the Leadership Board MUST acknowledge and take appropriate action for the raised issue
* Update Design Principles: The Leadership board MUST authorize updates to the design principles (another party, i.e. the sponsor, may actually update the design principles artifact)
