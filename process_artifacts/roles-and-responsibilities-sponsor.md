# OVAL Sponsor Roles and Responsibilities
This document characterizes the roles and responsibilities of the OVAL Sponsor (the "Sponsor"). The Sponsor is essentially the conservator of the OVAL Language, providing infrastructure, logistical, and community support to further the language.

Requirements language in this document are defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

# General Responsibilities
In general, the Sponsor will:
* Function as the OVAL account owner: own all project resources such as GitHub account containing repos, mailing list accounts, etc.
* Manage Area Supervisor appointments to ensure that each [Area of Responsibility](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/blob/master/process_artifacts/areas-of-responsibility.md) has at least one Area Supervisor.

# Language Governance Responsibilities
The Sponsor has a less critical role in governing the OVAL Language than other roles. Note that the individual(s)/organization with the Sponsor role may play additional roles in the language development process.

## Language Development

* Logistical Support: The Sponsor provides logistical support during the release process
* Release Announcement: The Sponsor is responsible for announcing OVAL Language releases
