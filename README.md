# Updating the OVAL Language Development Process
This repository is the working area as members of the OVAL Board work to define an updated language development process. This work is based largely on an initial effort memorialized in [working_doc.md](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/blob/master/working_doc.md).

This entire effort is a ***work in progress***. We are starting at the higher levels of abstraction, gaining feedback from the wider Board, and iterating to lower levels of abstraction until we arrive at an implementable process.

We are tracking a variety of issues [here](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/issues), and are on a weekly meeting schedule to iterate through the process, so that we can address each of these issues (many of which were the direct feedback of various Board members).

We have also created a simple project to track actions that may not be specifically releated to issues [here](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/projects/1).

# Language Development Process Goals
1. Provide a central place of record for versions of the OVAL specification
2. Provide mechanisms for the OVAL community to revise and augment the specification in order to maintain current capabilities and expand capabilities within current use cases
3. Provide forums for the OVAL community (language developers, content producers, content users) to discuss OVAL-related topics
4. Provide a mechanism for listing tools that support the OVAL specification
6. Be transparent and open to the public
    1. Issues
    2. Language proposals
    3. Decisions
    4. Governance process and execution
    5. Board membership
    6. Schema supervisor assignments
    7. Coordinate the hosting of online and/or offline events
7. Encourage contributions from the public
8. Adopt policies and practices that allow language development speed and agility while maintaining respectable stability.
9. OVAL Language specifications and schemas must be provided under licensing terms that are commercially friendly and not overly prohibitive.

# Abstract Process Framework

This is our ***work-in-progress*** process framework, which describes various roles and the gist of the overall process, with most of the details being contained in various [process artifacts](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/process_artifacts).

![Process Diagram](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/blob/master/graphics/png/language-development-0.5.png)

A note about interpreting the diagram (which is also available in [PDF form](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/blob/master/graphics/pdf/language-development-0.5.pdf)). Process steps (rounded rectangular shapes) with dotted-line boundaries indicate areas that will likely require a sub-process of its own. For example, the box labeled with "Release" is certainly more complicated than simply releasing, and will likely have it's own process diagram to aid in explaining how the ultimate release process goes.

The pink-ish document shapes (with the bent upper right corners) represent artifacts relied up on by the associated process step. A fille in arrow in the upper left of one of these symbols would represent an output artifact, whereas a "clear" (white) arrow would represent an input artifact. For example, the "Release" step of the process presently requires two process artifacts: Proposal Accepance Guidelines, and Release Instructions.

The rest of the symbols should be largely self-explanatory, but if clarifications are needed, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/issues/new), so that we may address it.

## Abstract Process Description
Coming soon. *[This section will describe in summary form each of the process steps above]*
