# Updating the OVAL Language Development Process
This repository is the working area as members of the OVAL Board work to define an updated language development process. This work is based largely on an initial effort memorialized in [working_doc.md](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/blob/master/working_doc.md).

This is our ***work-in-progress*** process framework, which describes various roles and the gist of the overall process, with most of the details being contained in various [process artifacts](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/process_artifacts).

We are tracking a variety of issues [here](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/issues), and are on a weekly meeting schedule to iterate through the process, so that we can address each of these issues (many of which were the direct feedback of various Board members).

# Language Development Process Goals
1. Provide a central place of record for versions of the OVAL specification
2. Provide mechanisms for the OVAL community to revise and augment the specification in order to maintain current capabilities and expand capabilities within current use cases
3. Provide forums for the OVAL community (language developers, content producers, content users) to discuss OVAL-related topics
4. Provide a mechanism for listing tools that support the OVAL specification
6. Be transparent and open to the public
    1. Issues
    2. Language proposals
    3. Decisions
    4. Governance process and execution
    5. Board membership
    6. Schema supervisor assignments
    7. Coordinate the hosting of online and/or offline events
7. Encourage contributions from the public
8. Adopt policies and practices that allow language development speed and agility while maintaining respectable stability.
9. OVAL Language specifications and schemas must be provided under licensing terms that are commercially friendly and not overly prohibitive.
