# Updating the OVAL Language Development Process
This repository is the working area as members of the OVAL Board work to define an updated language development process. This work is based largely on an initial effort memorialized in [working_doc.md](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/blob/master/working_doc.md).

This is our ***work-in-progress*** process framework, which describes various roles and the gist of the overall process, with most of the details being contained in various [process artifacts](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/process_artifacts).

We are tracking a variety of issues [here](https://github.com/CISecurity/oval-governance-update/issues), and are on a weekly meeting schedule to iterate through the process, so that we can address each of these issues (many of which were the direct feedback of various Board members).
